## There are two ways to participate in the workshop:

#### Before CogSci (Virtual)

In advance of CogSci 2023, we will be hosting an interactive virtual seminar **Monday, July 17, 2023** from **noon-1PM ET**.
This session will open to the public and streamed online, allowing attendees to participate in this component of the workshop from anywhere in the world. 
These virtual talks will be recorded and available online for asynchronous viewing, alongside other materials recorded from speakers who are not able to attend CogSci in person.

**Please register [here](https://forms.gle/mHxV3f8Xp3nhuDQ3A) if you are interested in attending the virtual session and we will keep you updated!**

#### On-site at CogSci (Sydney)

As part of the ``flipped'' workshop format, the workshop in Sydney will focus primarily on interactive, in-person discussion.
We will stream recordings of our virtual seminars for those who were unable to attend, and feature several live presentations on conducting Cognitive-AI Benchmarking studies.
Please find a [rough schedule here](/schedule/).
